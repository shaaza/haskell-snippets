## Usage
The purpose of the code in this repo is entirely pedagogic, and hence the code is meant to be entered into an interpreter via ghci :l or loaded into an IDE and used accordingly. The usage details of the functions are given in the README specific to each snippet. (click one of the links above)

1. Prerequisite:
* Install the Haskell Platform (you just need `ghci` though) from [https://www.haskell.org/platform/](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
